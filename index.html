                    Your objective in this game is to find matching triplets of images by flipping the cards. Each
                    correct match will earn you a point. The more points you score, the better!

                    1.There are a total of 10 different images in the container, with each image appearing 3 times. That
                    makes a total of 30 cards for you to flip.
                </p>
                <p class="gameplay">
                    <span>gameplay</span>
                    1.To flip a card, simply click on it. Clicking on a card will reveal the image on the other side.
                    Remember, each click counts as one flip. <br>

                    2.You can click on two more cards to reveal their images as well, trying to find three cards with
                    the same image. <br>

                    3.When you successfully find three cards with matching images, all three cards will be removed from
                    the container, and you will earn one point. <br>

                    4.If the three cards you flipped don't match, they will be flipped back face down. <br>

                    5.Keep flipping cards to find more matching triplets. Pay attention to the cards you've already
                    flipped to improve your chances of finding matches. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="scoring">

                    Each correct match (finding a triplet of identical images) will earn you one point. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="timer">
                    <span>timer</span>
                    The timer will start counting as soon as you begin the game and will continue running until you
                    decide to end the game. <br>
                    You will see the elapsed time in seconds, minutes, or hours, depending on how long you take to
                    complete the game.
                </p>
                <p class="restarting">
                    <span>restarting</span>
                    After the game ends, you can choose to play again.. <br>
                    Get ready to test your memory and matching skills in the Cards Flip Game. Have fun, and let the
                    flipping begin! <br>
